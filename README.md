Bose SoundTouch App (using java)

Starting a new project to use java for my soundtouch app. Just a beginning I've used code from Dave Drager for the TCP connection, the rest is still to be developed.

https://systembash.com/a-simple-java-tcp-server-and-tcp-client/ << Dave's TCP client software here.

Todo:

1/ create a user interface (e.g. power on/off volume up/down etc)
2/ search and connect to the soundtouch automatically (via UPnP?)
3/ configure this app to run on a browser
4/ further develop to include selecting a media stream and programming preset keys
